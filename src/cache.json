Universe is built to empower everyone to create their own home on the internet.\r\n\r\nWe're looking for a Web developer to help accelerate our mission. You'll focus on frontend development but you'll take on tasks throughout the stack. You'll expand our renderer: adding support for new blocks types, more complex layouts, and more customizations for each block. You will help build infrastructure that supports custom domains, per site metadata, and unlimited pages all invisible to our creators. You'll help maintain our node.js APIs behind the scenes. And you will expand our browser support coverage.\r\n\r\nOur renderer is a server side React app using Next.js. Our APIs are currently written in Node.js. We support a wide range of block types and customizations from users so we are building a system more than just an app. Strong skills of the basics in HTML and CSS necessary along with the ability to write clean React code that can handle a lot of inputs. The renderer is all about hiding the complexity of each website our creators design so all they see is a beautiful representation of their creation.\r\n\r\nThis is a full time position and 100% remote. Experience working remotely is definitely a bonus. We offer health benefits and generous vacation because everyone needs to recharge their batteries.\r\n\r\nWe're looking for someone sharp, internally-driven, and passionate about building powerful tools for everyone. If you're interested, shoot us a note to join@onuniverse.com.\r\n\r\n",

We are a small and diverse team with a good mix of engineers and team members with restaurant experience. We help hundreds of small to medium sized restaurants from michelin 3 stars and regional chains to mom and pop operations. Some of the problems we are trying to solve now are \"Why can't restaurants just search for the best priced chicken instead of calling up a dozen suppliers?\", \"Can there be a searchable archive of all the data restaurants generate ?\", \"How can we perfectly digitize millions of invoices\"\r\n\r\nThe Role \r\nPlate IQ is looking for a Frontend Engineer to lead our product efforts and help us take our current product, loved by many restaurants across the country to the next level. We use modern web technologies so we can iterate quickly and also provide opportunities for our designers to chip in. Expertise in Angular is a big plus but familiarity with other modern JavaScript UI libraries (React, Ember, etc) is a solid substitute.\r\n\r\nWe are not tied to Angular so if you have a strong background in other frameworks and would like to migrate our code to React/Ember etc, we are open to that. Taking ownership of the product frontend and leading the way is the most important trait we are looking for.\r\n\r\nIn a typical week you would.. \r\n- Discuss, plan, and build new features onto our Angular codebase \r\n- Collaborate with designers, product managers and other stake holders in defining the user experience \r\n- Triage and fix bugs, often working directly with our existing users \r\n- Manage code reviews through pull requests to make sure we're moving fast while also maintaining quality codebases \r\n- Help migrate our AngularJS codebase to Angular [N] <-- insert latest version here.\r\n\r\n- We consider the following things to be critical to your success.. \r\n- You think critically about your work and ask questions in order to improve the product, not only in its technical implementation but also in how well it’s serving the needs of our users \r\n- You have built products and UI using modern web technologies and can point to your prior work \r\n- You have strong communication skills and are able to explain complex technical topics to the entire team in a clear and concise way \r\n- You love front-end technologies but also eager and able to dig into other areas of the product as needed \r\n- When things inevitably break—you eagerly jump in to diagnose and fix the core issues\r\n\r\nExperience working in an early stage startup is a huge plus.",

We then use the data and machine learning to tailor-make beauty products that actually work, because they are formulated specifically for you own individual skin.  \r\n\r\nCustomers fill out an online quiz (questions cover age, ethnicity, lifestyle, and geographic location) to receive a unique skin profile and set of skincare products based on findings from the Beauty Genome Project. \r\n\r\nWe are changing not just the way that consumers discover and buy beauty products, but also how CPG companies are operated, with less wasteful, more targeted marketing, more efficient inventory turnover, and longer customer life time value using data and personalization.\r\n\r\nPROVEN was selected to be in the Oscars gift basket to this year's nominees, and has been featured in New Beauty, Fast Company, TechCrunch, the Verge, and the Huffington Post. \r\n\r\nPROVEN had just graduated from Y-Combinator.

    "hiring_description": "We are a team of technologists, software engineers, doctors, nurses, and lean healthcare experts with on-the-ground experience solving operational challenges in clinical environments. Qventus helps hospitals like Stanford/Mayo Clinic/Emory/New York Presbyterian reduce wait time for patients, prevent patient falls, and generally helps hospitals deliver a better and safer experience for patients, resulting in reduced injuries, loss of life, and financial waste.\r\n\r\nWe're making a big difference. \r\nQventus has meaningfully affected patient experiences and outcomes for almost 4 million patients across the united states. Our platform works with hospital data to predict negative outcomes for patients and associated potentially disastrous situations that are likely to occur, then applies our system of action to reach the right doctors and nurses, at the right time, telling them where to go to stop these events before they happen. Think Minority Report applied to hospitals.\r\n\r\nOur founding team has done this before. \r\nTwo of our three founders worked in consulting for over a decade solving efficiency problems in hospitals. They know hospitals, where they've been, where they want to go, and how to work within them to drive the necessary mind shift and change management we need to drive this new wave of technology.\r\n\r\nOur team is top notch! \r\nWe have the fortune of having amazing engineerings and data scientists from top schools (Stanford, MIT, Cal, etc.) applying the latest in artificial intelligence and machine learning to create products that help healthcare organizations around the world and their people adapt in the moment and make the right decisions from the most complex data. Furthermore, we employ several practicing clinicians (practicing surgeons, doctors, nurses) in the company to help us understand the hospital environment. We take what we do very seriously.",
    "tech_description": "Engineering is comprised of several teams: - Web Apps: Responsible for our web platform and associated services. - Mobile: Responsible for our mobile products (iOS and Android). - Data Platform: Responsible for ETL, data processing and platform, managing data lifecyle from customer ingest to persistence, serving data to data science and web apps groups. - Data Science: Responsible for our ML development. - DevOps: Infrastructure and associated infrastructure services, working with teams to build and maintain CICD pipelines. - QA: Responsible for quality definition, automation, QA infrastructure, driving quality process from development through release. Functional QA is largely outsourced, we prefer to have QA team focused more on the engineering required to scale a large QA org.\r\n\r\nSome of the challenges we are facing:\r\n\r\n1) Using AI/ML- We use predictive analysis to help doctors and nurses make proactive operational decisions so they can focus on patient care\r\n\r\n2) Data scaling- We are starting to get significantly larger volumes of data, which is also increasingly becoming more and more clinical (lab results, etc) in nature.\r\n\r\n3)Data sensitivity- Because this data is more clinical, it is more sensitive and requires a higher bar on how we set up and monitor our systems.\r\n\r\n4)Data Ingestion- Getting data out of hospitals is not an easy task. We have to figure out more scalable solutions to help us grow quickly. This is an industry wide problem and we are looking to do it better than just about anyone else.\r\n\r\n5)Product growth- Expansion in more areas of the hospital means we have more to learn and an opportunity to expand our product to achieve more outcomes.",

We care about great user experience, deeply understanding user needs, scalable engineering, comprehensive and accurate instrumentation.\r\n\r\nWe are a cross-functional team of product minded full-stack engineers, machine learning engineers, designers, data analysts and product managers that sit side by side and make it all happen. In terms of the maturity of our efforts and systems, we have neither figured it all out nor are we flying blind - a great time to join. We have a mix of simple data mining approaches, many classical supervised learning models and some deep learning based approaches out there already. We watch metrics like reorder rate, replacement happiness ratings and search conversion rates that are predictive of user retention and gross margin.\r\n\r\n### About the role\r\nYou will build data products; this is neither an analysis only role nor an engineering only role. You will, in fact do both of these and more. You will work with product managers to help identify and understand opportunities and formulate problems and prototype models. You will also engineer your solutions for scale while relying on a fairly mature technology stack and work with product engineers to A/B test experiences in the field. And finally you will collaborate with data scientists to understand experiments and fine-tune your problem solving approach. For areas where machine learning is at the heart of the effort, you will be responsible for the roadmap.\r\n\r\n### About You\r\nYou will succeed in this role if\r\n\r\n* you have 3+ years industry experience solving problems in search/recommendations/computer vision/ad targeting\r\n* you have a graduate degree in AI/machine learning//statistics or equivalent self study and experience\r\n* you have strong programming skills in python and fluency in data manipulation (SQL, Spark, Pandas) and machine learning (scikit-learn/keras/tensorflow/pytorch) tools\r\n* you have an applied research mindset and are excited about recent developments in multi-modal deep learning and causal inference with biased/noisy datasets\r\n* you care about the business impact of your work while being mindful of the ethical implications\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n* Talented and collaborative coworkers who will both push and support you\r\n* Personal growth plans that let you stretch yourself or grow in new directions\r\n* Market competitive salary, equity\r\n* Medical, dental, vision benefits and 401(k) retirement plan\r\n* Great office in downtown SF\r\n* Take what you need vacation ( and we really mean it )\r\n* 16 weeks maternity leave / 8 weeks paternity leave so you can truly bond with your child\r\n",

About 1% of all online sales will be disputed this year and Chargehound is best suited to capture that opportunity. As online sales grow, so does Chargehound, and we're looking for someone exceptional to join our team.\r\n\r\nYou'll be responsible for interfacing with external customers and helping them develop integration solutions. You'll need to be comfortable meeting with clients and walking them through the integration process, as well as managing, documenting, and discussing APIs and client libraries in the context of a larger system integration. You should be comfortable with modern programming languages as we support a number of them. See our [API Documentation](https://www.chargehound.com/docs/api/2017-10-30/#overview) and [Quick Start Guide](https://www.chargehound.com/docs) for examples.\r\n\r\nYou'll have a huge amount of autonomy and will be expected to make significant contributions throughout the sales and integration processes. You should expect to work with engineers and non-technical stakeholders, acting as a subject matter expert to help bridge the gap when needed. Being able to concisely and accurately distill technical concepts into plain english, both written and verbally, is very important.\r\n\r\nBecause our team is small, you'll have the opportunity to interact directly with everyone involved and should feel comfortable managing multiple engagements at once.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to empathize both with users and the rest of our team. This means considering both how our customers use our software and how the product and engineering team have designed our software to be used.\r\n\r\n### Sample Projects:\r\n\r\n- Create a client library for our API using a modern programming language you have not used before. Make sure to use the language's best practices and add it to our reference documentation.\r\n- Our sales team is pushing a deal forward, but needs some help explaining the integration to a project manager. Join them in a meeting and provide the technical expertise required to reassure the potential customer.\r\n- A new large customer wants to automate their chargeback flow immediately. They have all of the data they need in a internal portal, but don't have the engineering resources to do an API integration for another quarter. Propose a solution to get the process started as soon as possible and implement it.\r\n- A customer emails integration support and is having some trouble receiving our web hooks. Investigate the situation and walk them through the process until they are receiving and responding to the web hooks as expected.\r\n- Update our reference documentation build process to generate a set of documents for each API version.\r\n\r\n### Our ideal candidate will:\r\n\r\n- Have experience building and maintaining products with real-world usage.\r\n- Have experience interfacing with external clients, or very strong internal project management experience.\r\n- Have experience working on client-side and server-side code.\r\n- Be able to quickly code and design working prototypes.\r\n- Be willing to travel if needed.\r\n- Be willing to pick up the slack and do unglamorous tasks.\r\n- Have opinions about good and bad API design and the ability to justify them.\r\n- Value the importance of good documentation.\r\n- Concisely and accurately distill technical concepts into plain english, both written and verbally.\r\n- Become familiar with the financial and business context around chargebacks, so you can talk about the workflow in client meetings - we'll help with that.\r\n\r\n### Nice to haves:\r\n\r\n- Extensive familiarity with at least two programming languages.\r\n- Well acquainted with a modern web framework and RESTful APIs.\r\n- Experience integrating with payment processors.\r\n- Open source work.\r\n\r\nApplying:\r\n\r\nPlease include a summary of the products/solutions/engagements you've worked on that you’re most proud of and why. Make sure to send us links and source code if available.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds interesting, we would love to hear from you.
